# 2 transitions will be fired.
# They have source states in different orthogonal components.
# There's no conflict here, but the sequence of those transitions are still important.
# The current scheme is "implementation-dependent".
# test9 and test10 in this directory shows the SVM approach.
# SCC, since it calls SVM to sort these transitions, also conforms to this approach.
