This directory and its subdirectories contain a set of tests for different
SVM/SCC features (see the names of the subdirectories).

$ make svm
to test SVM simulation with these tests. You must have SVM in the PATH.

$ make python
to test the Python code generated by SCC. You must have SVM and SCC in the
PATH.

$ make cpp
to test the C++ code generated by SCC. You must have SVM, SCC and GNU C++
in the PATH.

$ make java
to test the Java code generated by SCC. You must have SVM, SCC and JDK 1.4
or higher in the PATH.

$ make csharp
to test the C# code generated by SCC. You must have SVM, SCC and Mono 0.30
or higher in the PATH.

$ make
  or
$ make all
the combination of "make svm" and "make python"

$ make scc
the combination of "make python", "make cpp", "make java" and "make csharp"

$ make full
the combination of "make svm" and "make scc" (a complete test on SVM and
SCC, usually takes 15-20 minutes)
