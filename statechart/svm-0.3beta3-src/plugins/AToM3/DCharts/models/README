DCharts examples in this directory:

RedNGreen/
 small example model which is first simulated an from which 
 subsequently a Python class is synthesized using SCC

SimpleChatRoom/
 an example of communication (via ports) between multiple
 DCharts models (one ChatRoom and multiple Clients in this case).
 This runs in a distributed fashion on top of PVM.

m0_DCharts_mdl.py
m1_DCharts_mdl.py
 Basic states: default state, enter actions, exit actions 
 Events: trigger, guard, actions, display string

m2_DCharts_mdl.py
 Hierarchical states: default, contains relationship

m3_DCharts_mdl.py
 Event priority: outer-first (by default, may be changed in .des)
 
m4_DCharts_mdl.py
 Orthogonal components: contains relationship
 time delay: AFTER(n)

m5_DCharts_mdl.py
 History state: deep, default

m6_DCharts_mdl.py
 Nesting of orthogonal components inside a state

m7_DCharts_mdl.py
 Orthogonal components with time delays

m8_DCharts_mdl.py
 Broadcasting of events: with parameters

m9_DCharts_mdl.py
 state reference ([OC in State] guard)

plant_DCharts_mdl.py
 a model of a physical plant in an orthogonal component
 a model of a software controller in an orthogonal component
 first, simulate the overall system
 then, use the software controller model to synthesize code

TrafficLight_DCharts_mdl.py
 a model of a traffic light
