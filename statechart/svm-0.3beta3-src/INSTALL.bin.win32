To enable PVM support for distributed simulation, you must install
PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine, http://www.netlib.org/pvm3/).
Download a win32 package with install shield and install it.

You will see PVM error messages if PVM is not correctly started. This
does not hinder you from using SVM to simulate stand-alone models.
